 			<p>From the moment we first met to this day, if there is one thing that has always been constant is love, care and excitement & the fear of the unknown. I was single and likely to stay single until I didn’t meet you. Going back in time, from the day I saw you first, stared into your eyes and dived deep into your soul to the day when you said yes whilst I rolled the ring into your beautiful finger, everything appears to me as a fairy tale. Time has never passed so fast. This is, by all means, the best time of my life. It’s like I have got everything I ever asked for. A partner for life, a best friend and my partner in crime. I have never felt luckier.</p>
            <p>I’ll be lying if I say I am not scared. I’ll be lying if I say I am ready. I’ll be lying if I say this is what I planned for. I’ll be lying if I say I believed in marriages. I’ll be lying if I say I want to settle down.</p>
            <p>I don’t.</p>
            <p>I am scared but I know perfect love drives out all fear. I am not ready but the idea of being with you looks just perfect. I never planned for this but you are the best thing that happened to me. I don’t believe in marriages until I met you. I don’t want to settle down and with you along I just want to stargaze and see the clouds pass by in slow-mo.</p>
